A kind of social weather app that provides information like tempreture , humidity and so on. Then based on these factors the application will suggest reccommened clothing and activities.
It does this by intergrating the IpgeolocationAPI from (https://app.ipgeolocation.io),
and uses a weather API from (https://open-meteo.com) for the data on Weather based on the users Latitude and Longitude.
This project has assisted me with my main gaol of learning key concepts like:
1.API intergration
2.Basic networking in C# with the HTTPClient
3.WPF and XAML
4.How to combine UI with behind the scenes technology
